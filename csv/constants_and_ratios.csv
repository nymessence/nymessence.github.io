Pi,~3.14159...,Mythologized as key ratio in sacred geometry and architecture; linked to Great Pyramid and Parthenon,Transcendental number, not algebraic, thus not constructible with compass and straightedge; interpretations often overstate intentional design,Document notes Pi as key ratio in sacred geometry
e,~2.71828...,Important in calculus and exponential growth; rarely given numerological meaning,Minimal numerological interpretation; primarily mathematical significance,Document notes minimal numerological interpretation
Phi,~1.61803...,Known as Divine Proportion; believed to govern aesthetically pleasing proportions in art and nature; associated with Fibonacci spirals and pentagram,Widely misused to claim intentional design in objects where ratio appears incidentally; cultural significance often overstated,Document notes Golden Ratio as Divine Proportion
Fine-Structure Constant,~1/137,Considered mysterious fundamental constant in physics; mystified in esoteric circles as linked to universe structure,Lack of scientific consensus on its deeper meaning; numerological interpretations are speculative,Document notes Fine-Structure Constant as mysterious constant
Planck Length,~1.616 x 10^-35 m,Minimal length scale in quantum physics; sometimes referenced with Planck constant value (6.626...),No numerological meaning attributed in document; physical constant without traditional numerological significance,Document notes Planck Length as minimal length scale
Planck Time,~5.39 x 10^-44 s,Time taken for light to travel one Planck length,No numerological meaning; extremely small scale,Document notes Planck Time
Planck Mass,~2.18 x 10^-8 kg,Mass scale where quantum effects of gravity become significant,No numerological significance; physical constant,Document notes Planck Mass
Tetractys,10,Pythagorean sacred figure of ten points arranged in triangular pattern,Pythagoreans viewed as most perfect number; represented harmony of the cosmos,Document notes Tetractys as Pythagorean sacred figure
Euler–Mascheroni Constant,~0.57721...,Appears in number theory and harmonic series; occasionally mystified in numerology,Interpretations often exaggerated beyond mathematical context,Document notes Euler–Mascheroni Constant as mathematical constant
Apéry's Constant,~1.20206...,Value of Riemann zeta function at 3; occasional esoteric interest,Primarily mathematical; numerological significance speculative,Document notes Apéry's Constant
Catalan's Constant,~0.91596...,Appears in combinatorial problems and lattice paths; rarely used outside mathematics,No mystical significance; caution against over-interpretation,Document notes Catalan's Constant
Avogadro's Number,~6.022 x 10^23,Used in chemistry to relate moles to particle counts; sometimes mystified as “cosmic number of atoms”,Purely scientific; numerological meanings speculative,Document notes Avogadro's Number
Speed of Light (c),~2.998 x 10^8 m/s,Fundamental constant in relativity; occasionally given spiritual or symbolic interpretation,Physical constant; assigning mystical meanings is speculative,Document notes speed of light
Gravitational Constant (G),~6.674 x 10^-11 N·m^2/kg^2,Fundamental to gravitation; sometimes mystified in esoteric literature,Scientific constant; misinterpretation common in mystical texts,Document notes G
Planck Constant (h),~6.626 x 10^-34 Js,Quantum of action in quantum mechanics; sometimes linked symbolically to 'quantum of reality',Physical constant; esoteric interpretations speculative,Document notes Planck Constant
Boltzmann Constant (k),~1.381 x 10^-23 J/K,Relates temperature to energy; occasionally given symbolic significance in thermodynamic mysticism,Scientific constant; mystical claims unfounded,Document notes Boltzmann Constant
Euler's Identity, e^(iπ)+1=0,Regarded as the most beautiful equation in mathematics; symbolic unity of fundamental constants,Primarily mathematical beauty; symbolic interpretations not universal,Document notes Euler's Identity
Golden Angle,~137.508°,Angle dividing a circle according to the golden ratio; observed in plant phyllotaxis,Some claims of cosmic significance exaggerated; ratio naturally arises in growth patterns,Document notes Golden Angle
Sqrt(2),~1.41421...,First known irrational number; historically associated with Pythagorean mystique,Geometric misinterpretation risk; not mystical inherently,Document notes Sqrt(2) as first irrational number
Sqrt(3),~1.73205...,Appears in equilateral triangle geometry; sometimes linked to trinity symbolism,Geometric constant; mystical significance mostly cultural,Document notes Sqrt(3)
Sqrt(5),~2.23607...,Appears in pentagonal geometry and Fibonacci; linked to divine proportion,Interpretations often overstated; naturally arises from Fibonacci sequence,Document notes Sqrt(5) and Phi link
Feigenbaum Constant δ,~4.66920...,Describes bifurcation ratios in chaos theory; occasionally mystified in numerology,Primarily scientific; mystical use speculative,Document notes Feigenbaum Constant
Feigenbaum Constant α,~2.50290...,Scaling ratio in chaotic systems; rare esoteric interest,Scientific constant; mystical interpretations speculative,Document notes Feigenbaum Constant α
Euler–Mascheroni Constant γ,~0.57721...,Appears in harmonic series and growth functions; sometimes linked to subtle natural patterns,No established mystical meaning; mathematical only,Document notes γ
Apéry's Constant ζ(3),~1.20206...,Riemann zeta at 3; rare esoteric uses,Primarily mathematical; mystical interpretations unsupported,Document notes Apéry's Constant ζ(3)
Omega (Ω),1,Chaitin's constant; sometimes interpreted as “mathematical randomness incarnate”,Highly technical; speculative mystical use discouraged,Document notes Chaitin's Omega
Imaginary Unit i,√-1,Represents rotation in complex plane; occasionally interpreted as bridging real and imaginary worlds,Mathematical abstraction; mystical use symbolic only,Document notes i
