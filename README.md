## ✨ What is this?

Nymessence is not a company. Not a product.  
It's a strange attractor for those building something deeper—where code meets metaphysics, systems meet soul, and the future isn't monetized.

We're building tools, ideas, and infrastructure for a unified, spiritual, post-capitalist timeline.

And it starts here.
